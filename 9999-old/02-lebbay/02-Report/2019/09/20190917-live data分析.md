## 1，Live  Date原先方案解析

### 01,  前端

- 代码定位：app/tpl/admin/orderNumber/realtimeStat.htm



### 02, 后端逻辑

- 代码定位：app/tpl/admin/orderNumber/realtimeStat.htm
- 具体方法：private function _realtimeStat($date, $exclude_cancelled_orders = false)
- az项目代码具体：839行
- 解析在代码中:
  - 简单说明：
  - 其实就是从数据库中读取当天的数据， 按照小时进行分组，然后每个小时的数据存储起来
  - 

```mysql
select
  # 时间，当天的第几个小时
  hour(pay_time) as compute_date,
  # 这个是每小时总订单数
  count(*) as average1day,
  # 这个是每小时总金额
  ifnull(sum(goods_amount), 0) as amount1day,
  # 这个代表付钱金额不是0的订单个数
  sum(if(order_amount > 0, 1, 0)) as real_order_number_1day,
  # 这个代表付款呢金额是0的，也就是免单的订单个数
  sum(if(order_amount = 0, 1, 0)) as free_order_number_1day,
